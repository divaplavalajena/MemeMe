# MemeMe

An iPhone app in Swift that allows users to take pictures - either from within the app
or by selecting from the photo album - and overlay text to make memes.

These memes can be shared via social media or email, and past memes can be viewed
in a table or collection view.

Note: Currently there is _**no**_ persistence of data between app closing and reopening.  
An update is in process to add persistence in the form of Core Data so that memes
persist between app closing and reopening.
